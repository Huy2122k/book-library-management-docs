I already read this before but I just had to read this again. Jake is Emily's boss. He is ruthless in business. When it comes to his women, although not exactly the love them and leave them kind of guy, he does not allow any of them in his heart. Enters Emily, his personal assistant. A shy and seemingly unattractive woman. When Jake makes it his business to do a makeover for Emily and to teach her how to flirt and how to act on dates, it is a disaster and heartbreak just waiting to happen since both of them eventually realize that they feel something for the other. Funny & romantic. A must read!",2021-7-30 0:53:35

Rae is a girl training to become a Cleric until one day she discovers she is a fairy. So, starts this book. The entire storyline takes place in 2 days but, oh boy! does a lot happen in 2 days. Rae is thrust into a war between 2 fairy factions, 2 love interests (the fairy named Breandan and the vampire named Tomas) and so on...I found the idea of the story interesting. This book does have some potential IF some very big issues are addressed.Grammar: If there was ever a book in need of an edit, this is the one. The grammatical errors, missing words, wrong words (at one point the author writes `right' when it should have been `wrong'), etc. made reading the book so distracting and frustrating that I could barely concentrate on the plot. I don't think I went 2 pages without encountering a mistake.Character development: Characters are largely undeveloped and have no depth, even the main ones. For example, we get very little in terms of interaction between Rae and her best friend Alex, so the events of the end did not have any effect on me whatsoever. We didn't get to care about Alex at all. We learned little about her, and only through Rae's narration. Basically, that is the problem, we learned everything from the author telling us than from the character development.Character interaction: I will make allowances for Rae's sudden trusting happy lovey dovey relationship with Breandan but, not with Tomas. We get no frame of reference, rhyme or reason as to why Rae is interacting with the vampire Tomas the way she is. From their first encounter to the second, there is a world of difference. I mean, talk about jumping the gun!Basically, this is a story with potential if the author decides to review it and expand on the book, fix the errors and get a good editor. Also, am I missing a chapter between 9 and 10? :/ That was a BIG jump in events.",2020-2-16 7:33:52

It's a surprisingly uninspiring short story about an apparently very conflicted woman being forced into the company of the man she had walked out on the day before their wedding, many years earlier.This book was a freebie, but even at that price I'm ambivalent as to whether or not it was worth it.  The female lead character, Kasie, was unremarkable, and seemed to obsess on imaginary conflict where none existed.  The male lead, Chayton, was not much stronger.  I found it annoying that he demanded that Kasie cook and work around the cabin when he had kidnapped her and held her at his snowed-in cabin against her will. He seemed to think that her initial refusal to ""pull  her weight"" made her a brat, but it was actually her repeated complaints about her parents' trying to ""control her life"" that made her a whiny brat.Kasie's weak character was more and more annoying as the book went on, but when she finally meets up with her father after many years of estrangement, she acts almost as though her total lack of contact never happened.  If she was that annoyed over all those years about her father ""controlling her,"" she would not have been able to warm up to him or his new wife that quickly.  Basically, the author manufactured Kasie's feeling she was ""controlled"" by her parents to create some sort of tension in the story, a conflict to be overcome, but it's just too contrived to be believable.The ending was awkward, with Chayton suddenly acting entirely out of character compared to how he behaved in the prior 95% of the book, with no explanation for why he changed so dramatically from one scene to the next.  And what 26 year old woman is still a virgin, especially when she is supposedly about to marry a famous, handsome rock star, and who thinks she would prefer to just live with him instead?  The author seemed to require that Kasie remain chaste all those years away after she left Chayton and her father, however it was fine that Chayton had had ""his share of flings!""  The old double standard - reinforced by a modern day female author.  Wow.",2020-9-1 22:24:25

At least I know I can read them digitally when I want to. Too bad the entire series isn't part of this set.Burroughs' writing style would be considered comically stereotyped and hackneyed by modern standards, but the themes of chivalry, bravery, and respect for others are timeless - even though they might be considered out of style by modern standards.
